<h4>Introduction of Data Structure</h4>
<h5>What is a data structure ??</h5>
==> 
An extremely important part of the programming language.
1) Data Structure are always of storing data in a efficient manner and accessing them as and when required.
row text:-

    DS --> storing data --> in --> efficient manner and accessing--> when --> required.

2) Lots of variables of data structures across programming language.
3) Data Storage, Organization, accessibility and efficiency are at play all the time.

    Data Storage --> data organisation --> access data --> efficiency == Data Structure

<h5>Types of data structure</h5>
<h6>There are 2 main Types:-</h6>

<h5>1) Builti-in Data Structures :</h5>
<h6>1) List:-</h6>
1. List are used to store data in a sequential manner.
2. Negative indexing and positive indexing supported.
3. Lists are supported indexing and slicing structure.
4. List is an ordered collection of element enclosed within [].
5. List are mutable.(change is supported, add, remove, and update)
    
ex.

    L1 = [1, "a", False, "b", True]
    
o/p:

        [1, 'a', False, 'b', True]

<h6>2) Dictionary:-</h6>
1. Dictionary are one important data type in python.
2. Data is stored in key:value pairs in the case of dictionaries.
3. Pairs can be added, accessed and deleted as needed.
4. Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed with {}.
5. Dictionary are mutable.

ex.
    
    dict_item = {'first':'apple', 'second':'Ball'}

o/p:

    {'first':'apple','second':'ball'}

ex.

    d1 = {"mango": 45, "apple": 30, "orange": 77, "guava": 125}

o/p:

    {"mango": 45, "apple": 30, "orange": 77, "guava": 125}

ex.

    d1.keys()

o/p:

    dict_keys(['mango', 'apple', 'orange', 'guava'])

<h6>3)Tuple :-</h6>
1. Tuples are most used data structure in python.

2. works similar to that of list but this is immutable.

3. so, data one entered into a tuple connot be changed.

4. Tuple is an ordered collection of element enclosed within()

5. Tuple are immutable.

6. Heterogeneous collection of Data(Various type of data we can store in Tuple).

ex.
    
    sample_tuple = (1, 3, 2)

o/p:

    (1, 3, 2)

ex.
    
    tup1 = (1, "a", True, "b", 23.0)

o/p:

    (1, "a", True, "b", 23.0)

<h6>4)Set :-</h6>
1. Sets are collection of unordered unique element.
2. Every data element in set must be unique.
3. The operations are similar to the sets you might.
4. enclosed with {}
